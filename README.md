You can either log in with your credentials or register a new account.

### In-Game View

After signing in, you will be redirected to your village view. The village is displayed as a rendered tilemap.

At the top, you will find a bar showing your resources:
- üåæ Food
- üå≤ Lumber
- üß± Bricks
- ‚öíÔ∏è Iron

These resources are essential for developing and growing your village over time.

The grey squares in the village represent construction sites.  
Interacting with a construction site will open the building menu, where you can spend resources to construct buildings.  
Some buildings will increase the production rate of different resources.

On the left side of the screen, you will find a navigation bar.
